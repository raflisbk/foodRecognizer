This folder is for Lottie animation files (optional).

You can add custom Lottie animations from:
https://lottiefiles.com/

Example animations you might want:
- loading.json (loading animation)
- food.json (food related animation)
- success.json (success animation)

Currently, the app uses Flutter's built-in animations with animate_do package.
